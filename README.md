# My Setup Script for a Minimal Raspberry Pi Pico Development Environment

```sh
wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tassoevan/setup-pico-env/main/setup-pico-env.sh | sh
```

This script will install all the dependencies to build and flash code to a
Raspberry Pi Pico. It will also install the `pico-sdk` and `pico-examples`
repositories under the `~/.pico` directory.
